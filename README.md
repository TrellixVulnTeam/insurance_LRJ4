Insurance Premium Prediction

Problem Statement: Insurance is a growing industry and also medical expenses of individual is increasing. And still there are lot of people who abstain from taking insurance. The challenge is to provide simple tool which can be accessible to people. By projecting future medical expenses based on the previous records, can give a fare estimate on policy premiums of an individual. With a few input parameters like age, sex, bmi, etc. people can see their medical expense. This will increase awareness on health insurance and as a result prospective customer base will increase

Goal: It is an attempt to predict future medical expenses by using available dataset "insurance.csv". We will apply multiple linear regression models and choose the best one which gives the best result.

1. Data Ingestion:
Data ingestion is the process in which unstructured data is extracted from one or multiple sources and then prepared for training machine learning models.
2. Data Validation:
Data validation is an integral part of ML pipeline. It is checking the quality of source data before training a new mode
It focuses on checking that the statistics of the new data are as expected (e.g. feature distribution, number of categories, etc).
3. Data Transformation
Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that would be more suitable for model building.
It is an imperative step in feature engineering that facilitates discovering insights.
4. Model Training
Model training in machine learning is the process in which a machine learning (ML) algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from.
5. Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
Model evaluation is important to assess the efficacy of a model during initial research phases, and it also plays a role in model monitoring.
6. Model Deployement
Deployment is the method by which we integrate a machine learning model into production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.
